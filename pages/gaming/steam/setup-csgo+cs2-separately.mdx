# Installing CS:GO and CS2 Seperately

## Introduction

This is a tutorial about how to install a copy of CS:GO but also keep CS2 in
your library so you don't need to install CS:GO or CS2 whenever you want to
change games

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
### Installing CS:GO

- In the Steam app, navigate to your library and to the Counter-Strike 2 page

- Either right-click Counter-Strike 2 on the left (as shown) and select
  `properties` OR alternatively click the gear and select `properties` from
  there

![Open properties](/assets/gaming/steam/csgo+cs2/csgo2.jpg)

- That will bring you to Counter-Strike 2's General game settings page; go to
  `Betas` on the left

- Under `Beta Participation` drop menu, select
  `csgo_legacy - Legacy Version of CS:GO`

- Exit out of the settings page and now Steam should be prompting you to update
  the game so it may download all the CSGO files

<Callout type="warning">
  This WILL overwrite your current CS2 game, most of your settings should be
  saved but I recommend creating a autoexec file to save all of your settings
  and take a note of your video settings as those cannot be set by command-line
</Callout>

### Create a separate CSGO game entry on steam

- Browse to local files

- Navigate up to the `common` folder using one of the methods circled in the
  screenshot below and make a copy of the cs folder; you may rename it if you'd
  like

  Here's an example of the folder being renamed, not crucial to the process but
  may make it easier for you to identify the game

- Select `Browse`

- Copy the Directory for your CSGO file and paste it into the directory of the
  File Explorer page that opened when you clicked `Browse`. Make sure to press
  enter

## Conclusion

You have just added CSGO back to your steam library; don't forgot to navigate
back to CS2 and change beta selection back to `none`
