# Docker-CLI CLI Documentation

Welcome to the Docker-CLI section of our documentation. This area is dedicated
to providing comprehensive guides and resources for managing and optimizing your
Docker-CLI environments. This is not a guide on Docker Desktop.

## Recommended Actions

You should start with installation if you are working from scratch, otherwise
use guides as needed for your enviroment. If you are learning how to use
Docker-CLI, going from top to bottom may make it easier to understand.

These guides may presume you have some basic knowledge of linux and its CLI, if
you have not learned them, it may make life easier to do so.

## What You Will Find

- **Docker-CLI Installation**: This guide will walk you through the initial
  installation of Docker-CLI.

- **Docker-CLI Single Node**: This guide will walk you through starting a single
  node of Docker-CLI.

- **Docker-CLI Swarm Nodes**: This guide will walk you through starting a Swarm
  of Ducker(QUACK) nodes.

- **Docker Compose**:

- **Docker Stack**: This guide shows the melding of Swarm and Compose.

- **Docker Custom Images**:

- **Docker Troubleshooting**: This is a condensed area for Troubleshooting
  advice from all guides.

## Future Updates

Updates will depend on how out of date a guide may get. Roadmaps will depend on
if I get run over.

## Getting Started

This section will be made to be partially run from top to bottom, however not
every guide needs to be used. To begin, explore the guides listed above or
navigate through the sidebar for specific topics. If you're new to Docker-CLI,
we recommend starting with the basics and gradually moving on to more advanced
configurations.

For any questions or feedback, there are probably better guides out there or
[offical docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) or you can try to reach

Happy Containerizing!
