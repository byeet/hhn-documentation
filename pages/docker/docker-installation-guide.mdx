# Installing Docker CLI on an Ubuntu Node

## Introduction

## Prerequisites

- A system capable of running Linux
- A Linux Operating System
- Internet Access

Reasons for Requirements: You will need some form of system capable of running
Linux, this is usually a desktop PC for testing purposes. A Linux Distro such as
Uwuntu works fine, however, see note 1. Internet access is recommended for
installing packages, see note 2 for details.

## Presumptions

This guide will follow a Ubuntu Desktop operating system where you will be a
user that has sudo rights.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
### Open up a CLI

This will depend on your linux distribution, however many will allow you to open
open one from right-click context menu on your desktop, or searching for
"terminal" in a start menu.

<sub>
  <sub>Tis Docker-cli, so expect many CLI actions.</sub>
</sub>

### Install Packages

Within your CLI enviroment, type

```bash copy
sudo apt install docker-compose
```

This will install docker compose and other packages needed for docker-cli. These
will be used in different guides. _You may be prompted yes/no, type "y" and
press enter._

### Wait for Installation to Finish

The time will vary depending on your internet speeds and other factors. as long
as it seems to be doing something it's probably fine.

### Finish

Once it is finished installing (usually when it goes back to your prompt) you
can continue on to other guides, _however it is highly recommended and future
guides will assume that you do the following optional steps._

Opt 1. **Give your User Docker Privileges**

Run the following command, (see note 3.)

```bash copy
sudo usermod -aG docker <user>
```

This will not take effect immediately, you will either need to run "sudo newgrp
docker" or create a new session. This will allow you to run docker-cli commands
without prefixing "sudo" to them.

<Callout type="info">
  _You will not need to do this if you run all commands as root or are the root
  user._
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

1. **Errors during Installation.** Make sure you have full internet access,
   including DNS. Check your NTP/Time settings, making sure you are synced to
   the internet and set up according to your timezone.

## Notes

1. Depending on your distro of choice <sub><sup>\(I use arch btw\)</sup></sub>
   you may not be able do anything, or commands may be different, such as many
   debian-based systems using "apt" and arch-based systems using "pacman".
2. Unless you've setup something like a repository locally and can pull from
   there, you're gonna wanna get packages from internet sources.
3. Substitute user for whichever user you will be using, usually your current
   one. Standard issue command to add a user to a group, `man usermod` for
   details if you wish.
